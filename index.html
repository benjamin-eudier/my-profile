         Son of two merchant parents, I am passionate about entrepreneurship. I'm only one goal, which is to reach the top of it and to be happy!

       <h2>GASTRONOMY</h2>
       <p>
       Not just a word, it's a passion that is integral to my way of life. I like to discover new tables and gastronomic cultures, which make me travel with each new bite.
       Not only an epicurean but also a cook in my spare time. I don't just try to discover new flavors thanks to the addresses I can find, but rather to understand how the dish could have been prepared, and how I in turn can duplicate it. 
       </p>
       <p>
       In short, I love the world of food.

       <h2>OLD MECANICS</h2>
       <p>
       A family passion that has also become mine. From the age of 16 I started to touch my passion in more detail. I had a TW 125cc in its original condition and turned it into a cafe racer, alone from A to Z. Then since it was my dream since I was 14, I wanted to have an old BMW. Thanks to the seasons during which I was able to work, I put aside the money with which I bought a magnificent R65 from 1980 transformed into a café racer by JERIKAN.
       </p>
       <p>
       Today my dreams are less accessible but not impossible, that's why I want to fight to the end and not regret.

       <h2>MUSIC & CINEMA</h2>
       <p>
       Music is really something that relaxes me. I love music because when I listen to it I am alone in my bubble and no one is there to bother me. Music is also memories, past moments that we remember thanks to a sound. We know him, he tells us something. This is when an image appears to us. To come to the image and therefore the cinema, there is such power behind these pixels of green, red and blue, but also behind this imagination that the writers write and that the directors build.
       I love cinema for the beauty of the image, and the fantastic which makes us believe that anything is possible and imaginable.

       <p>
       Dreaming is a force that gives our body the chance to be optimistic and to move forward towards the future, to change it or to change itself.
